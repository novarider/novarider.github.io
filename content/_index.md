Title: About me
---

I grew up in the middle of Austria's mountains in a touristic valley
called [Montafon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montafon).
There I lived until I started my Bachelors Studies at Vienna's
University of Technology in 2015. In 2019 I moved back to Vorarlberg and
started working for [Gantner](https://gantner.com) as a
Software Developer with main focus on Front End Applications.

A lot of my free time I spent outdoor. I love exploring the mountains
around me in summer and winter. In doing so I don't care how I move on,
but my all time favorites are snowboarding, hiking and climbing.

If the weather is too bad, I also love to try out new computer
technology. No matter if hardware or software, I am happy when I can
play around with it.
