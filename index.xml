So I started to search for it and found it on my old windows machine with this command&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>gpg --list-keys
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So I wondered if I can export this key and reuse it. Google as always had an answer for me!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Private GPG Keys are protected by a passphrase which is choosen when generating a keypair. By this mechanism
the private key file can be savely moved from one machine to another, because before a useage you need to know the
passphrase!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Glossary webpage with yaml and mdBook</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/mdbookglossary/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2023 22:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/mdbookglossary/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Today I finished my work on a glossary page. My goal was to have a single source of truth,
for wording which is used in my company and definition and translations to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I decided to use a *.yaml file to save source strings of the wordings, definitions and

abstract and a description. See the following example to get a notion:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My first experiences with devcontainers</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/devcontainers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2023 12:39:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/devcontainers/</guid><description>&lt;p>After an update of Visual Studio Code in my workplace, I encountered an added functionality: Devcontainers. So I decided to read into the topic. This lead to solving some problems in my workplace, which were unconformable to work with until now, but weren&amp;rsquo;t also that bad to start finding another solution for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s begin at the start of the story:&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-are-development-containers">What are development containers?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Development containers are, as the name suggests, containers which have the purpose to unify development experience.
