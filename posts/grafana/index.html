Historical data are then served as CSV and XML files, one file per day and measurement point.
The server also includes a limited visualization of the data, but no possibility to combine or compare the visualizations,
for example, a merged visualization from two different measurement points.</p><p>To easily analyze the produced or recorded data, we need a more sophisticated system. So the technology search started&mldr;</p><h1 id=grafanahttpsgrafanacomgrafana><a href=https://grafana.com/grafana/>Grafana</a></h1><p>Graphana as a visualization tool brings some really nice features with it</p><ul><li>Many data sources are supported via plugins
  - Great options for visualization
    - Different graphical charts/visualizations
    - Mixing different data sources or visualizations into one common one
  - Possibility to create alarms for the monitored data
  - Create dashboards from the created alarms and graphs/visualizations, which can then can be published</li></ul><p>From these points the tools seems perfect for our use case and because it is open source we can run it on our existing server without significant more costs.</p><h2 id=grafana-with-an-xml-data-source>Grafana with an XML data source</h2><p>So I pulled the <a href=https://hub.docker.com/r/grafana/grafana>Grafana docker image</a> and spun it up with default options to create a proof of concept.
And a few seconds later, I started to configure an XML data source with the home server&rsquo;s HTTP endpoint to fetch data from. This worked great and
in a few minutes, I had a graph with the data.</p><p>From that point on, it was easy to import a second dataset from the same server and create a first mixed visualization graph to compare the data.</p><p>There, I stumbled over the next problem. The server gives me for everyday a new HTTP endpoint, which makes it not that easy to create a visualization for
longer than one day into the past. So I decided to find a tech stack to persist my data independently of the server.</p><h1 id=influxdbhttpswwwinfluxdatacomproductsinfluxdb-and-telegraphhttpswwwinfluxdatacomtime-series-platformtelegraf><a href=https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb/>InfluxDB</a> and <a href=https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/>Telegraph</a></h1><p>So after taking a look at available plugins on Grafana and some research on the internet, I stumbled over InfluxDB, a database designed for time based data.
Which sounds perfect for the time based sensor data provided by the server. With Telegraph, there is also a worker service to move data from different
Data sources into the influx database, without creating much overhead, just some configurations.</p><p>So I think this is a pretty nice solution, which should work together pretty well without too much overhead. So in the next days I&rsquo;ll try out to set up the whole
stack with the help of docker on my server and will publish the results here on the blog.</p></div></div><div class=footer><p>This website is hosted on
